I aim to pursue a PhD in mathematics, and my career aspiration is to become an applied mathematician.

The robustness of a mathematical method determines its utility in applications. Just imagine designing a communication network that fails to account for dynamical perturbations, or modeling an epidemic with strictly deterministic differential equations. My goal is to research robust topological methods for data analysis and physical applied mathematics. My interests include algebraic topology, dynamical systems, and scientific computation.

Consider training a computer to distinguish the tone signature of different musical instruments. One can associate the persistence of holes in an audio recording's time delay phase space with a sample statistic: the persistent rank function (PRF). In correspondence with Nikki Sanderson, I learned a computer trained on PRFs more accurately classifies musical instruments than one trained on FFTs. In this case a topological invariant answers the question "which instrument?" with higher fidelity than frequency analysis.

My research interest stems from (i) my exposure to topology and its applications as a senior, and (ii) challenges I am facing in my second year of work in social services. 

Advised by Dr. Jonny Comes, in my senior independent study I examined how Galois theory constrains the solution space of Fuchian-type DEQs. Following Michio Kuga, we developed a theory based on the correspondence between the fundamental group of a plane region and that region's universal covering space. As a result, I parameterized a range of solutions to the hypergeometric DEQ. For interesting cases, I found their monodromy representation at singular points, and generated plots. I presented my method, its history, and a potential application to fluid flow The College of Idaho's 2016 student research conference.

At the same time, I studied point-set topology under Dr. Dave Rosoff. His course was led in a modified Moore method: no textbook or lectures, and emphasis on student presentations. Three classmates and I discovered there exists a topological space $X$, a set $A\subset X$, and a $X$-limit point $x \in A$ for which there is no sequence $x_i \in A$, $i \in \mathrm{N}$ such that $x_i \to x$. One such space is the space whose open sets are exactly those sets with countable complements. We had found a counter example to show the converse[^converse] of the following theorem is not always true: "Let $A \subseteq X$ be a subset of the topological space $X$. If $x_i \in A$ for each $i \in \mathrm{N}$ and $x_i \to x$, then $x$ is in the closure of $A$."

Meta-understanding of maths. Metaphorically a journey through an unfamilar domain. From [Eliezer Yudkowsky](http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/)
> believing, and updating on evidence, so as to systematically improve the correspondence between your map and the territory
As an occasional rock climber, I really enjoy the play between "math improves one's map of territory" and "programming is climbing a mountain". Rosoff once commented that a meta-theorem of math was to prove useful theorems alone, and once for all, so that higher level math can be done. Which amounts to having explored (either in detail or with breadth) common features and routes in the foundational territory of mathematical knowledge. I think of theorems and installations, then, as signposts in a domain. When performing mathematical research, or a long computation, theorems are like carabiners.

From [Philip Guo](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/code-carabiners-essential-protection-tools-for-safe-programming)
> Somewhere around a few hundred lines of code, your code base becomes too large to fit inside your head; you start to forget why you wrote certain code in a quirky way; and you don’t quite remember what you were trying to do last week, or what assumptions about your internal data structures still hold true. Is that snippet of documentation from last month still valid? What about this TODO note? And how come this function used to work so well but doesn’t anymore? What made it suddenly break? Wait, how did this other module ever work? ARGH!!!

From [How People Learn](https://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/LearningBiology/readings/How-people-learn.pdf) 
> The new science of learning does not deny that facts are important for thinking and problem solving. Research on expertise in areas such as chess, history, science, and mathematics demonstrate that experts’ abilities to think and solve problems depend strongly on a *rich body of knowledge about subject matter* (e.g., Chase and Simon, 1973; Chi et al., 1981; deGroot, 1965).  However, the research also shows clearly that “usable knowledge” is not the same as a mere list of disconnected facts. Experts’ knowledge is connected and organized around important concepts (e.g., Newton’s second law of motion); it is “conditionalized” to specify the contexts in which it is applicable; it supports understanding and transfer (to other contexts) rather than only the ability to remember.

- I divided up my time between personal and professional projects. Here I highlight some of my professional projects. In general, I focused on developing novel, scalable resources for persistent issues in refugee case management. I began to build an [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coltongrainger/ymca-resources) of forms and instructions for low income healthcare applications and rental assistance. I established contact with and solicited feedback from staff in the Harris Health System, at the Islamic Society of Greater Houston, and at Gulf Coast Community Services Association. I incorporated my experience in direct service with the higher-level feedback from each organization. I found the best way for case managers to submit applications and detailed exactly what is expected of the client during the application process. Because our clients have limited English proficiency, I emphasized that case managers need to be aggressive and “get the job done” when faced with unnecessarily complicated release of information constraints. I also learned more about Shaoli’s Refugee Health Working Group. I created and distributed a [map of clinics](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kk9yn6-4nifHLIf2tGYbW_7PiYo&usp=sharing). I participated in a refugee health needs assessment with medical students at Baylor. I even was fortunate to be invited to contribute to the design of a data management plan for the next refugee social service database. The above examples are united by a common thread: each represents a small contribution to a larger dialogue surrounding the resettlement of displaced persons.

[^converse]: However, the converse holds if $X$ is a second countable topology.
