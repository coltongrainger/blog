In light of COVID-19, and because my career goal is to contribute to a community of creative individuals (e.g., meteorologists, musicians, or applied mathematicians) I intend to take a position *developing software and manipulating exotic datasets* beginning Fall 2020, rather than returning to complete my Ph.D. at CU Boulder.

My immediate qualifications include

1. a year of professional **software engineering** experience at the National Center for Atmospheric Research;
2. background in **mathematics and data science** that drives me to produce high-quality software; and
3. domain-specific enthusiasm for exotic data, copyright law and **the distribution of creative works**.

**While I am well-equipped to work independently, I am new to software engineering as a collaborative process.**

At NCAR, I worked independently under Tom Cram[^tom] and Matt Mayernik on the reduction of meteorological data from binary image files using Python and SQLAlchemy. I designed a metadata schema and ingest system for a ~60 TB collection of scanned documents to reduce each ~6 MB image to about ~2 KB of metadata. 

For collaboration and project management, I've used `org-mode`, git issues, and kan-ban style boards. Though I have only a few months' experience working with teams to plan and prioritize a backlog, I am *endearingly hopeful* to have more soon.

**Doing mathematics, I learned how to have problem-solving conversations with myself and others; doing data science, I learned additionally how to describe and implement a solution in its domain-specific language.**

I am confident that I could both "create and sponsor new concepts" and "proactively investigate and solve technical issues". For example, I happy toggling between object oriented and functional programming paradigms. 

**Having been a student and an amateur DJ for as long as I can remember, I suppose I have done just about everything described in Daft Punk's _Technologic_ to every MIME type of data described in the RFC 6838.**

At least I have the decency to know I've plagiarised[^fair-use]
nothing. But, in all seriousness, aside from successfully implementing a RESTful API, I have wielded `audacity`, `mixxx`, `alsa`, `hydrogen`, `json`, `requests`, `youtube-dl`, `nginx`, `exiftool`, `easytag`, `ffmpeg`, `pandas`, NumPy, etc. to create, acquire, modify, deliver, and destroy digital content and its metadata. Specifically, I used `exiftool`, `pandas`, and NumPy in the image processing workflow at NCAR. As an example of how I might use these otherwise illicit skills for good, I am confident that I could "monitor content delivery processes and queues" while "troubleshooting and resolving issues" arising therein.

**To be explicit**. A subset of the tag cloud of technical tools I am confident using professionally looks like: 
`apache`, `bash`, `git`, `debian`, `gcloud`, `pickle`, `MongoDB`, `MySQL`, `nginx`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `PostgreSQL`, `python3`, `scipy`, `SQLAlchemy`, and `unittest`. 
I would need to "book up", but I could also use:
`C`, `Java`, and Amazon Web Services.

## notes

[^fair-use]: Gotta give credit where credit is due. Beyond that, I interpret the definition of fair use in [17 U.S. Code Sec. 107](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107) rather broadly.
